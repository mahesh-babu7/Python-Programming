Operators in Python (300 words)
Operators in Python are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Python includes several types of operators, each serving different purposes.

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations:

+  # Addition:       5 + 3 = 8  
-  # Subtraction:    5 - 2 = 3  
*  # Multiplication: 4 * 2 = 8  
/  # Division:       10 / 2 = 5.0  
%  # Modulus:        10 % 3 = 1  
** # Exponent:       2 ** 3 = 8  
// # Floor Division: 10 // 3 = 3


2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values:

=   # x = 5  
+=  # x += 3  (x = x + 3)  
-=  # x -= 2  
*=  # x *= 4  
/=  # x /= 2  
%=  # x %= 3  
**= # x **= 2  
//= # x //= 2

3. Comparison Operators
Compare values and return Boolean (True or False):

==  # Equal  
!=  # Not equal  
>   # Greater than  
<   # Less than  
>=  # Greater than or equal to  
<=  # Less than or equal to

4. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements:

and  # True if both conditions are True  
or   # True if at least one condition is True  
not  # Inverts the condition

5. Membership Operators
Check for membership:

in     # 'a' in 'apple' → True  
not in # 5 not in [1, 2, 3] → True

6. Identity Operators
Check if two variables reference the same object:

is      # a is b  
is not  # a is not b
Operators are essential in Python for performing calculations, comparisons, and logical operations within any program.
