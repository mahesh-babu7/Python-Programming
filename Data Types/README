In Python, data types are the classification or categorization of data items. Understanding data types is essential because it determines the operations that can be performed on data and the way it is stored.

1. Basic Data Types
int: Represents integers (e.g., 1, -5, 100).

float: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.01).

bool: Represents Boolean values (True or False).

str: Represents a sequence of characters or text (e.g., "Hello").

2. Collection Data Types
list: An ordered, mutable collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, "Python"]).

tuple: An ordered, immutable collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).

set: An unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).

dict: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 25}).

3. NoneType
None: A special type representing the absence of a value.

4. Type Conversion
Python allows type casting using functions like int(), float(), str(), and bool() to convert data from one type to another.

5. Dynamic Typing
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. For example:
