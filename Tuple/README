In Python, a tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed (i.e., you canâ€™t add, remove, or modify elements once created). This immutability makes tuples more memory-efficient and useful for storing constant data.

Creating Tuples
Tuples are defined using parentheses ():

numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
mixed = (1, "apple", 3.14)
