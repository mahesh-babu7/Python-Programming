In Python, a dictionary is an unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique, and it maps to a specific value. Dictionaries are used to store data in a structured way for fast lookup and flexible data handling.

Creating a Dictionary
Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {}:

person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}
