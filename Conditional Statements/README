Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False.

1. if Statement
Executes a block of code if the condition is true:

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")

2. if-else Statement
Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise runs the else block:

age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

3. if-elif-else Statement
Used when you have multiple conditions:

marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

4. Nested if Statements
An if inside another if:

x = 10
if x > 0:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive Even Number")
    else:
        print("Positive Odd Number")
