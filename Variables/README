In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. A variable acts as a symbolic name for a value, making the code easier to read and maintain.

Declaring Variables
Variables in Python are created when you assign a value using the = operator. For example:

name = "Alice"
age = 25
price = 19.99

You don’t need to declare the data type explicitly—Python automatically detects it based on the value assigned. This is known as dynamic typing.

Variable Naming Rules
Names must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or an underscore (_).

The rest of the name can include letters, numbers, or underscores.

Variable names are case-sensitive (Age and age are different).

Reserved words (like if, for, class) cannot be used as variable names.
