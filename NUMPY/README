NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

âœ… Installing NumPy

          pip install numpy

âœ… Importing NumPy
 
          import numpy as np

ðŸ“¦ Creating NumPy Arrays

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])     # 1D array
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # 2D array

NumPy arrays are more efficient than Python lists in terms of memory and speed.
