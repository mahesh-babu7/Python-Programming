In Python, a list is a collection of items that is ordered, mutable, and can contain elements of different data types. Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python.

Creating a List
Lists are defined using square brackets []:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
